# Welcome to the Employee Companies CRM. Here are some steps to get started:

# Prerequisites

*Make sure that the 'php' extension is to the path is available inside of your command prompt, and check that 'php artisan' commands are working correctly.

*Make sure composer is installed on the local system by running the command 'composer install'.

* Create a new blank database in the local phpmyadmin and call it something relevant (eg. employee_companies).

* Navigate to the root folder of the project inside the command prompt or terminal and run 'php artisan migrate --seed' to build and populate the databases.

* Inside of the .env file, alter the app url to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'.

* From the root directory, run 'php artisan serve'.

* Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your url field, and log in with 'admin@admin.com' and password: 'password'. The app will then launch.
